value-stream processing

A collection of commands to aid value-stream processing. 
Value stream means generalization of unix text processing to json stream.
jq (http://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is sed+awk in this context.
vals.py is where I throw in everything that jq cannot handle.

### todo
* unittests
* examples
* merge db, url handling
